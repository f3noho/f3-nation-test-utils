Today’s 3.6-mile ruck was a deep dive into the flavors of ice cream, witnessed in the early gloom.

Big thanks to our AOQ <@U04SUMEGFRV> for providing me with some sprinkles of support during this sweet journey. <@U05TMS255DH> I appreciate the new connection amidst our reflections on rocky road and vanilla highs and lows.

We finished at 06:19, returned enriched by the experience, reminded of the power of our collective stride through life’s sundaes.

Mumble chatter key point of reflection came from <@U04SUMEGFRV>: As HIM's, we can't just expect others to follow the "Golden Scoop". When we meet those who don't, it's our duty to lead by example, living out the Golden Scoop and its tenets to set the standard for how we should be treated.
