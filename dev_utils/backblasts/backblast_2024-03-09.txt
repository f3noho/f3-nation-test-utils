6 PAX showed up for a sizzling breakfast-themed beatdown, ready to get 1% better and show their AOQ some syrupy appreciation.

:back-blast:
WARMUP:
36 Pancake SSH, 10 Bacon Grass Grabbers, 10 Egg Vigoda, 10 Sausage Poopers, 10 Toast Soldiers, 10 LBAC, Flapjack for 10 more, 10 Syrup Claps.

THE THANG:
Theme for today - a few of my favorite breakfast combos.

WAFFLE (never caught on like I had hoped)
Each corner of the pavilion was a different breakfast exercise - Merkins, Imperial Walkers, Lunges, Flutter Kicks.  10 reps at each corner, 3 rounds.

Back at start - What's New Omelet.  YHC brought back our favorite song.  PAX perform Hillbilly Walkers for the duration of the song. Every time "omelet" is sung, a Star Jump is performed.

One round of the BACONATOR (again, never caught on like I had hoped).
20 reps of each of the following:
Pancake Ohnos
Hashbrown Squats
Syrup SSH
Egg Merkins
Toast Outlaws
Lunges
Elbows 2 Knees

Minute 2 Win It
I thought <@U05H7BV7X8A> did a great job with this one.  Although I didn't have it pre-recorded.
Minute AMRAP of the following:
Plank Hold
High Knees
BBSU
Nolan Ryans (switch at 30 seconds)
Wall sit (2 minutes on this one)

Mosey to the basketball court for about 15 minutes of breakfast relay to close it out.

Time.  Sufficient exercise.

MARY:  Not enough time today, everyone was full!

Form your breakfast teams early! Only 10 per team, but you can always join forces at the griddle. 2.0s welcome for extra flavor!

COT:
TAPS to stay in the COT. Prayers for all PAX, friends, and family recovering from life’s sticky challenges.

May we all continue to pursue a life of flavor and gratitude, knowing we aren’t alone and can always reach out to a brother for a pancake or support.

“Flip the script, stack the pancakes, and never waffle on your brothers.”

Steubie out.
